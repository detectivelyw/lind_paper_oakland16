This section discusses tools and techniques that have similar goals with Lind to realize privileged code protection through strong isolation between userspace and kernelspace.

	
\subsection{Virtualization}

Programming languages that provide safety through virtualization such as Java, JavaScript, Lua\footnote{http://www.lua.org/}, and Silverlight\footnote{http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/} are commonly used as sandboxing languages. The key idea behind these safe languages to provide virtualized environments to check safety of the running code operations by a monitor process. These sandboxes combine untrusted application code with an interpreter and standard libraries that consolidate routines to perform I/O, network communication, and other system sensitive functions. For example, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that functions as a sandbox to separate untrusted code from the OS in addition to performing safety checks for avoiding unauthorized branching in memory.

Though many sandboxes implement the bulk of their standard libraries in a memory-safe language like Java or C\#, flaws in memory-safe code can still pose a threat. In fact, many security critical bugs can be found in the standard libraries \cite{JavaBugs}. Researchers have also discovered many severe bugs in Java \cite{Java-Lessons}. Unfortunately, any bug or failure in a programming language virtual machine is usually fatal. Lind with a very small TCB (approximately 8K LOC) enhances security compared to the above virtual machines,  because of the POSIX implementation with Repy to build the sandbox.

OS virtualization is widely used in form of Type-I or Type-II to isolate untrusted applications that share the same hardware. Examples of Type-I virtualization (bare-metal hardware virtualization) are VMware ESX Server \cite{VMWare-ESX-Server}, Xen \cite{Xen-03}, LXC \cite{LXC}, Jails \cite{Jails}, Zones \cite{Zones}, and MS Hyper-V \cite{Microsoft-Hyper-V}. Type-II virtualization (hosted hardware virtualization) examples are VMware Workstation \cite{VMWare-Workstation}, VMware Server \cite{VMWare-Server}, MS Virtual PC \cite{Microsoft-Virtual-PC} and VirtualBox \cite{VirtualBox}. \gholami{do we need footnotes or references here for these products?} However, there are limitations with virtualization due to the large attack vectors against the hypervisors including vulnerabilities of software and configuration risk. For example, the small code footprint of a hypervisor can become a potential vulnerability and lead to serious problems. Maintaing two OSs in virtulized environments is among the other issues that have been discussed in \cite{Virt-Issues}. Attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities to escape these systems and access arbitrary code in the underlying host systems. Lind deals with these concerns by using a much smaller and safer TCB.

Library OSes are a useful approach for applications to efficiently obtain the benefits of virtual machines, 
including security isolation, host platform compatibility, and migration. Drawbridge \cite{Drawbridge-11} is a new program 
that uses lightweight processes and a library OS to present a Windows persona to a wide variety of Windows applications. 
This is accomplished by moving a large portion of the OS into the process, and presenting a simplified system 
virtual machine-like interface to each process. This approach brings many of the benefits of VM based temporal, 
spatial and fault isolation properties to a per-process level. Bascule \cite{Bascule}, an architecture for library OS extensions 
based on Drawbridge, allows application behavior to be customized by extensions loaded at runtime. 
Graphene \cite{Graphene-14} is a recent library OS system that seamlessly and efficiently executes both single and 
multi-process applications, generally with low memory and performance overheads. 
It broadens the library OS paradigm to support secure, multi-process APIs, such as copy-on-write fork, signals, 
and System V IPC. Haven \cite{Haven} uses a library OS to implement shielded execution of unmodified server applications 
in an untrusted cloud host. Haven leverages the hardware protection of Intel SGX to defend against 
privileged code and physical attacks, such as memory probes, but also addresses the dual challenges of 
executing unmodified legacy binaries and protecting them from a malicious host. 
The library OS technique is similar to Lind but differs in the fact that existing library OS systems rely heavily on 
the underlying kernels to perform system functions, while Lind only relies on a very limited set of system functions, 
and reconstructs most OS functions with our own safe Repy code. 

\subsection{System Call Interposition}

System call interposition offers a number of properties that make it attractive for building sandboxes, 
though it can be error prone \cite{SCI-04}. Approaches for delegation and filtering have been extensively studied, 
along with their respective tradeoffs between security and performance. 
Janus Version 2 (J2) \cite{Janus0:96, Janus:99} uses filtering and sandboxing, while Ostia \cite{SCI-04} uses a delegation. 
Ostia also provides a hybrid interposition architecture, which allows for kernel level enforcement and user policies. 
The kernel module enforces policy, denies direct access to restricted resources, 
and delegates certain calls to the emulation library, which sends transformed system calls to the agents. 
The agent reads the policy file and handles the delegation of calls. However, system call interposition has many problems. 
OS semantics are very difficult to replicate correctly. Indirect paths to resources are often overlooked, 
and there are side effects to denying system calls \cite{Problems-SCI}. 
Nevertheless, this technique is very useful and has inspired many new techniques, such as library OSes. 
The concepts behind System Call Interposition have evolved into other modern techniques 
and has benefitted many security systems, including Lind. 

\subsection{Software Fault Isolation}
Software Fault Isolation (SFI) is a sandboxing technique in which native instructions can only be executed 
if they do not violate the sandbox's constraints \cite{SFI:93}. Instructions usually exclude any directions that 
could jump outside the program's predefined memory region or execute a system call. 
Programs must use a specific compiler, which enforces these constraints before the programs are validated on load. 
Nooks \cite{Nooks:03} isolates Linux kernel modules, so that if they crash, the whole kernel does not crash as well. 
They use two techniques: sandboxing and micro-reboots. Nooks uses both as SFI-based and user-level sandboxes. 
Micros-reboots conceptually refresh small parts of the system. 
Google's Native Client \cite{NaCl-09} adopts SFI to execute untrusted x86 binary code safely. 
We leveraged this technique and used NaCl in our system Lind. The difference is that SFI doesn't handle the manner 
in which systems interact with the underlying OS. In NaCl, to perform system calls, 
it relies on a trusted service runtime for thread creation, memory management, and other system services. 
In Lind, we redirect system call requests to our safe POSIX interface, 
which allows Lind to control its own interaction with the underlying OS kernel.
