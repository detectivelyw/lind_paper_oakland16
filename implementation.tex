\section{Implementation of the Lind Prototype}
\label{sec.implementation}

Based on the design introduced in Section \S{\ref{sec.design}}, 
we implemented a secure sandbox system, Lind, 
for running untrusted user programs on vulnerable OS kernels. 
Lind adapts two basic  technologies as its building blocks\textendash Google's Native Client, and Seattle's Repy. 
As described in \S{\ref{sec.design}} (Figure \ref{fig:design}), our design has  two main components\textendash a computation module 
and a system API module. Google's Native Client served as the computation module 
and Seattle's Repy as the system API module (Figure \ref{fig:architecture}).

\subsection{The Computation Module of Lind: Google's Native Client}
We use Google's Native Client (NaCl) \cite{NaCl-09} as our computation module 
because it provides an environment for efficient execution of legacy code in the form of x86 and ARM binaries. 
NaCl can perform the functions required by the computation module well, and it is easy to 
connect with our system API module because NaCl uses glibc to perform system calls. 
Modification to NaCl's glibc would allow us to redirect those system call requests to our own system API module. 

NaCl is a sandbox used to execute untrusted x86 native code. 
It aims to give applications the computational performance of native applications without compromising safety. 
NaCl uses software fault isolation and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and 
side effects through interfaces managed by the program. It provides operating system portability 
for binary code while supporting performance-oriented features, such as thread support, 
instruction set extensions, such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and a hand-coded assembler. 
It also allows the efficient execution of legacy code in the form of x86 and ARM binaries 
that are built with a lightly modified compiler tool chain. 

\subsection{The System API Module of Lind: Seattle's Repy}

Seattle's Repy \cite{Repy-10} is a restricted subset of Python, that works as a sandbox to provide a safer environment 
to run applications. For Lind, we used Repy to build our system API module. 
To be more specific, our system API module has a very small sandbox kernel as TCB,  
written with Python. On top of the sandbox kernel, 
we use Repy code to safely reimplement complex system functions.

\subsubsection{The Repy Sandbox Kernel}

As we have discussed in \S{\ref{sec.design}}, the sandbox kernel needs to be secure and bug-free. 
Because it is the TCB of the system, any bugs within it could cause fatal problems, 
and allow attackers to access the OS kernel and gain kernel privilege. 
Seattle's Repy was selected as our system API module, because it has a very small sandbox kernel, 
comprised of only 8K LOC. Using Repy also demonstrated our key design principle that 
our system should only access the safe portions of the OS kernel. In the Repy sandbox kernel, 
there are 33 basic API functions, including 13 network functions, 6 file functions, 6 threading functions, 
and 8 miscellaneous functions (Table \ref{table:RepyKernel}) \cite{Repy-10}, \cite{RepyKernel}. Most of those functions are simple and 
regularly used system calls that access the commonly used kernel paths.

\subsubsection{The SafePOSIX Reimplementation}

The key responsibility of our system API module is to serve system call requests from user code. 
In the Lind system, those system call requests are issued from the user code, 
received by the computation module NaCl, and then redirected to our system API module. 
The API module includes a POSIX API to serve those requests. 

A POSIX API is a set of standard operating system interfaces that provide operating system functions 
to the user code. However, the POSIX API is large and complex, which means 
it would be really difficult to ensure that its implementation is secure and bug-free. 
Our choice to use Repy helped us solve this key security problem. 
Since Repy is a programming language sandbox, it can provide the ideal isolation 
we needed when constructing our POSIX API. In Lind, 
complex system functions are reimplemented using Repy code, 
based on the ``safe-reimplement'' principle from our design in \S{\ref{sec.design}}.

\subsection{Operations}

Here, we take a closer look at how Lind functions when an application seeks access. 
This discussion focuses mainly on the connection between Google's Native Client and Seattle's Repy sandbox.

Lind combines the NaCl and Repy component to provide native computation and 
safe access to the system. Untrusted programs are run in NaCl, 
but access to all system resources is diverted to a Repy program. 
This program is responsible for accessing the system on behalf of the program, 
which is called the Lind library OS. A NaCl sandbox is built on top of the Repy sandbox. 
To service a system call in NaCl, a server routine marshals its arguments into a text string, 
and sends the call and the arguments to Repy sandbox. 
The library OS then executes the appropriate system call, marshals the result and 
returns it back to NaCl. The result is eventually returned as the appropriate native type to the calling program. 

Lind is designed to minimize its modifications within the TCB of these two sandboxes. 
By running the Lind code is run from within the two sandboxes, 
the modifications to the sandboxes themselves (and therefore the TCB) were extremely small. 

The only complex part of Lind is the library OS, which runs in Repy. 
However, because Python is a very powerful language that provide rich functions, 
it significantly simplified the construction of Lind. Even though Python is considered ``slow'' by some, 
the internals of an application in Lind are run in NaCl, a very high performance environment. 
This balances the performance of the system, with the ease of implementation and maintenance 
of the library OS component of Lind. 

Furthermore, this particular design and architecture for sandboxing ensures the programs are portable. 
Programs running inside Lind are written to work against a standard POSIX glibc interface, 
and, since the Lind runtime is strictly user-level, it can work on many different platforms 
including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Finally, Lind is lightweight. Because the sandbox only incurs overhead when there is a system call, 
overall overhead for Lind is low. Lind uses a native interface for execution, 
allowing CPU-and-memory-intensive applications to run at speeds that are equivalent to NaCl and near native speed. 

\subsection{The Benefits of the Two Sandbox System}

In reviewing the design of Lind, some fundamental questions could be raised about the dual sandbox design. 
Why is one not enough? And, if two is good, why not use more? 
The answer to the first question is that the kernel interface is extremely rich and hard to protect. 
In order to have minimal impact on the kernel, as well as provide sufficient API for legacy applications, 
we need to have one sandbox focuses on protecting the kernel and providing POSIX API, 
while a second sandbox focuses on efficiently executing applications. 
So our approach includes two sandboxes, one as the computation module, 
and the other one as system API module. As to the second question, 
which could be rephrased as ``why not sandbox Repy TCB and get more security?,'' 
the lowest level sandbox eventually must have some fundamental, 
even if  limited access to system resources, such as memory, and storage, threads. 
So even if we were to sandbox Repy TCB and have additional sandboxes, 
the one at the bottom level will still access the OS kernel in a similar way. 
Thus, having multiple sandboxes does not provide any extra security benefits. 

In \S{\ref{sec.evaluation}}, we present how the dual sandboxes and other elements of Lind performed in 
head-to-head evaluation against other virtualization systems.
